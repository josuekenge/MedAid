# MedAid - Complete Setup Instructions

## What I've Fixed

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. **Updated all pages** to use Supabase API directly
2. **Fixed dashboard** - buttons now navigate to sections instead of "new" pages
3. **Created proper SQL schema** that matches your TypeScript types
4. **Added real-time updates** - when you add/delete, the UI updates immediately
5. **Fixed all CRUD operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete all work now

## Steps You Need to Do in Supabase

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `bsehgieuxjbnuiqmrnui`
3. **Click on**: "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. **Create a new query**
5. **Open the file**: `supabase-schema-updated.sql` (in your project root)
6. **Copy ALL the content** and paste it into the SQL Editor
7. **Click "Run"** button

This will create:
- `patients` table
- `nurses` table
- `services` table
- `visits` table
- All indexes, triggers, and sample data

### Step 2: Verify Tables Were Created

1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. You should see 4 tables:
   - `patients`
   - `nurses`
   - `services`
   - `visits`
3. Click on each table to see the sample data

### Step 3: Check Row Level Security (RLS)

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Policies**
2. For each table (`patients`, `nurses`, `services`, `visits`), you should see a policy named "Allow all operations"
3. This allows all read/write operations (you can customize this later for security)

## Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Add a Patient
1. Go to `/patients` page
2. Click "Add Patient" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test Patient
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: 555-1234
   - Date of Birth: Pick a date
   - Address: 123 Test St
   - Emergency Contact: Jane Doe - 555-5678
4. Click "Add Patient"
5. You should see a success toast message
6. The patient should appear in the list immediately
7. Go to Supabase → Table Editor → `patients` → You should see the new patient

### Test 2: Delete a Patient
1. Find the patient you just added
2. Click the red trash icon
3. Confirm deletion
4. You should see a success toast message
5. The patient should disappear from the list immediately
6. Go to Supabase → Table Editor → `patients` → The patient should be gone

### Test 3: Add a Service
1. Go to `/services` page
2. Click "Add Service" button
3. Fill in the modal form:
   - Service Name: Test Service
   - Description: This is a test
   - Base Price: 100
   - Min Duration: 30
   - Max Duration: 60

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Nothing happens when I add/delete"
**Solution**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Most likely: SQL schema wasn't run in Supabase
4. Go back to Step 1 and run the SQL schema

### Problem: "Failed to load data"
**Solution**:
1. Check your `.env` file has the correct Supabase URL and key
2. Make sure you ran the SQL schema
3. Check Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → verify tables exist

### Problem: "Form submits but nothing appears"
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Go to Supabase → Table Editor → Check if data was actually saved
3. If data is in Supabase but not showing, refresh the page
4. Check that RLS policies are set correctly (Step 3)

### Problem: "Cannot add visit - no patients/nurses"
**Solution**:
1. You need to add patients and nurses first
2. Go to `/patients` and add at least one patient
3. Go to `/nurses` and add at least one nurse
4. Go to `/services` and add at least one service
5. Then you can add visits

2. **Add search/filter** - Search bars exist but can be enhanced
3. **Add pagination** - For when you have many records
4. **Add authentication** - So only logged-in users can access
5. **Customize RLS policies** - Add row-level security based on user roles
6. **Add file uploads** - For patient documents, nurse certifications, etc.
